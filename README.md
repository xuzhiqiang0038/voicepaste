## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` in the project root and fill in your credentials:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `app.hotkey` | Global hotkey. Default template value is `Control+Space` |
| `app.hotkey_mode` | Hotkey trigger mode: `toggle` or `hold` |
| `app.remove_trailing_period` | Remove trailing `。` / `.` from the final text |
| `app.keep_clipboard` | Keep the result in the clipboard after paste |
| `app.theme` | Theme preference: `dark` / `light` / `system` |
| `connection.app_id` | Volcengine App ID |
| `connection.access_token` | Volcengine Access Token |
| `connection.secret_key` | Volcengine Secret Key |
| `connection.resource_id` | ASR Resource ID |
| `request.context_hotwords` | Custom hotwords list |
| `llm.enabled` | Enable LLM text polishing |
| `llm.provider` | LLM provider: deepseek / openai / anthropic / gemini / openrouter / siliconflow / ollama / openai_compatible |
| `llm.<provider>.url` | Provider API URL (leave empty for built-in providers) |
| `llm.<provider>.api_key` | Provider API Key |
| `llm.<provider>.model` | Provider model name |

Get your credentials from [Volcengine Voice Service](https://www.volcengine.com/product/voice-service).

Note: packaged builds ship `config.yaml.example` as the default config template, so the effective default hotkey is `Control+Space`. The code-level fallback `F13` is only used when `app.hotkey` is missing.

## FAQ

### VoicePaste doesn't work on macOS?

VoicePaste requires **Microphone** and **Accessibility** permissions to function properly.

**Microphone Permission**

1. Settings page → System Permissions → Click "Request Permission"
2. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone, make sure VoicePaste is authorized
3. If previously denied, reset via Terminal and re-authorize:
```bash
tccutil reset Microphone com.xuzhiqiang0038.voicepaste
```

**Accessibility Permission**

1. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, make sure VoicePaste is authorized
2. If reinstalled after deletion, you need to add it again

### Hotwords work during streaming but are wrong in the final result with non-stream enabled?

The non-stream (second-pass) recognition mode does not currently support hotword libraries or injected hotwords — only correction tables are supported. Create a [correction table](https://console.volcengine.com/speech/correctword) in the Volcengine console and replace `boosting_table_id` with `correct_table_id` in your config.
