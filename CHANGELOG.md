- **Corpus Workspace** — Added corpus browsing, filtering, export, analysis package generation, and replacement-word management for long-term voice input review.
- **History Metadata** — Preserved raw ASR text, final pasted text, mode, prompt, provider, model, character count, and recording duration in history records.

## v1.2.0 (2026-05-26)

- **LLM Text Polishing** — Integrate Vercel AI SDK with 8 provider support (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, Ollama, custom OpenAI-compatible) for post-processing ASR output (formatting, polishing, translation, etc.).
- **Prompt Template Management** — New `prompts.json` for managing multiple prompt templates, each with its own hotkey binding and trigger mode for different polishing scenarios.
- **Real-time Audio Waveform** — Live audio waveform visualization in the floating overlay during recording.
- **Notification Sounds** — Distinct start and end sounds to indicate recording readiness and recognition success.
- **DMG Build Output** — Added DMG format for macOS builds, fixing auto-update failures on read-only volumes.
- **Settings UI Polish** — Multi-provider selector, prompt template editor, refined hotkey keycap display with subtle superscript for left/right modifier distinction.

## v1.1.0 (2026-05)

- **Settings Home Page** — Added a home page with usage statistics, activity heatmap, and input history for a quick overview of your voice input activity.
- **Unified Pack Command** — Build macOS arm64 and x64 in a single `pnpm run pack` command, simplifying the release process.
- **Settings Redesign** — Reorganized settings page with sidebar navigation and auto-save for a cleaner editing experience.
- **Auto-Update Fix** — Prevented the auto-update check from re-triggering when saving config, avoiding unnecessary network requests.
- **CI & Release Overhaul** — Unified the pack script, added CI pipeline, and revamped the release skill for a more reliable build process.

## v1.0.8 (2026-04)

- **Update Install Fix** — Fixed auto-update restart not quitting on macOS (Electron 41) by explicitly calling `app.quit()` after `quitAndInstall()`.
- **Tray Cleanup** — Destroy the system tray before restart to prevent the app from hanging during auto-update install.
- **Simplified Update UI** — Consolidated check/download/install into a single state-driven button with progress and auto-recovery.
- **Update Diagnostics** — Added Squirrel.Mac native updater event listeners and install-flow logging for troubleshooting.

## v1.0.7 (2026-04)

- **Faster Startup** — WebSocket connection and audio device initialization now run in parallel during the "connecting" phase, reducing the delay from hotkey press to recording start.
- **CJK Text Fix** — Removed unwanted spaces between consecutive Chinese/CJK characters in ASR recognition results.

## v1.0.6 (2026-04)

- **Hold-to-talk Mode** — Added `app.hotkey_mode` with `toggle` and `hold` modes, including settings UI support for press-and-hold voice input.
- **Hotkey Precision** — Recorded left/right modifier keys are now matched exactly, so left and right `Ctrl` / `Shift` / `Alt` / `Command` no longer trigger each other.
- **Overlay Readiness** — The overlay now turns green only after audio capture actually starts sending data, making the status indicator closer to real recording readiness.
- **Hold-mode Stability** — Short hold cancellation no longer emits a spurious WebSocket error while the ASR connection is still opening.
- **Faster Startup** — Reduced audio chunk size to improve perceived startup latency when recording begins.
- **Settings UI Cleanup** — Split the old “General” section into “Hotkey” and “App Settings”, simplified hotkey hints, and updated the config-path field presentation.

## v1.0.5 (2026-04)

- **Windows Fix** — Resolved "not a valid Win32 application" error caused by macOS-compiled `uiohook-napi` native module being packaged into the Windows installer. Added `prepack:win` script to clean the build directory before packaging, allowing the correct Windows prebuild to load at runtime.

## v1.0.4 (2026-04)

- **Theme Support** — Light / dark / system theme preference in settings, persisted via `app.theme`
- **Unified Color System** — `theme.css` as the single source of truth for overlay and settings windows
- **Settings UI Polish** — Restructured toggle layout (title left, switch right, field path below), theme selector as inline button group, removed verbose descriptions
- **Overlay Fix** — Reset card dimensions on hide to prevent flash of stale size
- **Build Fixes** — Disabled native rebuild for Windows packaging, fixed startup crash and ASR config error handling
- **Code Quality** — Added @biomejs/biome for linting and formatting

## v1.0.3 (2026-04)
